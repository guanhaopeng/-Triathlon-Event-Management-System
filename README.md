# -Triathlon-Event-Management-System

TriSeries is a triathlon event management system which monitors multiple race types for
multiple users. These include individuals such as triathletes and spectators, as well as
organisations such as hosts, sponsors and charities. The system can keep track of who has
signed up to the system, who has registered to events and stores individualsâ€™ race data for
them to access post-race, while fundraising data can also be stored for charities associated
with events.
In order to implement the system, requirements were drawn out to map out what is included
in the application. Use cases were specified and linked together to further describe the
functionality of the system. Analysis and design models were then drawn up to detail how the
application functions as a whole from a systematic and theoretical perspective. An
application mock-up was then finalised to visualise the system and how it would function.
